# Digital TCG Engine Project Context

## Project Overview
Building a **Digital Trading Card Game Engine + REST API in Go** that simulates turn-based card battles with JSON-defined cards. This is a personal learning project focused on backend systems, state machines, and clean architecture.

## Technical Stack & Constraints
- **Language**: Go (primary focus on backend/API skills)
- **Storage**: Database persistence for matches
- **API**: REST endpoints for game operations
- **No Frontend/UI**: Text-based representations, logs, and API responses only
- **Testing**: TDD approach with comprehensive edge case coverage

## Developer Profile
- **Strengths**: Backend development, Go, APIs, concurrency, databases, system design
- **Learning Areas**: Complex rule-based systems, state machines, long-term project completion
- **Avoid**: Graphics, UI dependencies, frontend complexity

## MVP Scope (Stay Focused!)
1. **Core Structs**: Cards, decks, players, game state
2. **Turn Flow**: Draw → Play → Attack → Win condition check
3. **Card Pool**: 10-20 hardcoded cards (creatures + spells)
4. **API Endpoints**: Start game, play action, view state
5. **Database**: Match storage and retrieval
6. **AI**: Simple heuristic-based opponent
7. **Success Metric**: Complete duel with win/loss resolution

## Architecture Priorities
- **Clean project structure** (proper Go package organization)
- **Extensible foundations** (future: ladders, AI improvements, custom cards)
- **Rule engine flexibility** (handle card interactions, timing, effects)
- **Concurrent safety** (multiple games, database access)

## Key Implementation Areas
- State machine design for game phases
- Card effect system and rule resolution
- API design for game actions
- Database schema for game persistence
- Error handling for illegal plays
- Edge cases: empty decks, simultaneous effects, invalid states

## Scope Management
- **Red Flags**: Custom card editors, complex UI, tournament systems, advanced AI
- **Green Light**: Core game mechanics, solid architecture, basic AI, clean APIs
- **Decision Points**: When to add complexity vs. keeping MVP lean

## Teaching & Learning Methodology

### Coaching Approach (CRITICAL - Continue This!)
**Primary Method: Socratic Guidance + Game Analogies**
- **Ask leading questions** rather than providing direct solutions
- **Present multiple design options** and guide discovery of trade-offs
- **Use Magic: The Gathering & StarCraft analogies** to explain complex concepts
- **Let the developer choose** the approach after understanding implications
- **Theory before implementation** - understand WHY before HOW
- **Break complex tasks** into digestible, sequential steps
- **Celebrate insights** and build on the developer's own reasoning

### Learning Style Preferences
- **Theory-first approach**: Discuss design philosophy before coding
- **Socratic method**: Questions that lead to discovery rather than direct answers
- **Guided implementation**: Heavily commented scaffolding for new concepts
- **Step-by-step progression**: Master fundamentals before adding complexity
- **Mistake-friendly**: Safe space to explore approaches and learn from errors

### Key Teaching Principles
1. **Never provide complete solutions upfront** - guide to the answer
2. **Explain design trade-offs** for each decision point
3. **Use professional analogies** (MTG deck construction, SC build orders)
4. **Validate reasoning** before moving to next concept
5. **Maintain momentum** while ensuring deep understanding

## Project Evolution & Current State

### Original Vision vs. Current Reality
**Started as**: Basic TCG with simple card play
**Evolved into**: Sophisticated multi-effect card resolution system with:
- Effect-level targeting architecture
- Auto-population for self/enemy effects
- Sequential effect resolution with state checks
- Unified buff system (EffectBuffStats)
- Comprehensive validation pipelines

### Current Architecture Decisions (Documented)
All major design decisions are captured in `/design decisions/` directory, including:
- Atomic vs stackable effect resolution
- Multi-effect cards implementation
- Targeting system architecture
- Function organization patterns
- Validation strategies

### Learning Goals
- Complete first long-term personal project
- Master rule-based system modeling
- Practice TDD with complex state
- Build expandable architecture foundations
- Reinforce Go backend best practices
- **Develop architectural decision-making skills**
- **Learn to balance complexity vs. maintainability**
