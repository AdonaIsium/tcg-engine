# Save Game State: September 28, 2025 - 3:00 AM

## ðŸŽ‰ What We Accomplished Today

### Major Architecture Transformation âœ… COMPLETE
Successfully transformed the TCG engine from single-effect cards to a sophisticated multi-effect system:

**Core Systems Implemented:**
- **Multi-Effect Cards**: Cards can now have `Effects []Effect` instead of single effects
- **Effect-Level Targeting**: Each effect declares its own target requirements
- **Auto-Targeting Logic**: Self/enemy effects auto-populate, players only choose "free" targets
- **Owner/Controller System**: Cards track both owner (original deck) and controller (current control)
- **Zone Management Helper**: Production-ready `moveToGraveyard()` function with proper owner logic

**Technical Achievements:**
1. **Data Structure Updates**: âœ…
   - Updated `CardDef` to use `Effects []Effect`
   - Added `Owner` and `Controller` fields to `CardInstance`
   - Updated all function signatures to handle `[]*TargetRef`

2. **Validation System**: âœ…
   - Multi-effect validation in both `PlayCard()` and `CanPlayCard()`
   - Auto-targeting validation for self/enemy effects
   - Comprehensive error messaging for target count mismatches

3. **Effect Resolution Pipeline**: âœ…
   - Sequential effect resolution with auto-targeting
   - Function map pattern for clean effect dispatch
   - Context-based effect parameter passing

4. **Zone Management**: âœ…
   - `zones.go` with robust `moveToGraveyard()` helper
   - Handles all zones (deck, hand, board, graveyard)
   - Proper owner vs controller logic for stolen cards
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

5. **Test Coverage**: âœ…
   - Updated all existing tests for new multi-effect structure
   - Added multi-effect spell test cases
   - Auto-targeting validation tests
   - Diverse effect type coverage

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### 1. Implement applyDamage Function (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Goal**: Make damage effects actually work
**Details**:
- Handle both player and creature damage
- Player damage: Reduce `Life` field
- Creature damage: Reduce `CurrentHealth` field (allow negative/overkill)
- Integrate with `moveToGraveyard()` for creature death
- Validate target exists and is damageable
- Future: Add invulnerability checking (TODO placeholder)

**Function Signature**: Already defined in `playcard.go`
```go
func applyDamage(ctx *EffectContext) error
```

### 2. Add Creature Death Logic
**Goal**: Dead creatures automatically move to graveyard
**Details**:
- Check if `CurrentHealth <= 0` after damage
- Call `moveToGraveyard(creature, "destroyed by damage")`
- Handle graveyard ordering (spell first, then creature)

### 3. Implement CleanupTurn Function
**Goal**: End-of-turn creature healing
**Details**:
- Create `CleanupTurn()` function called by `EndTurn()` before player switch
- Heal all creatures to full health: `CurrentHealth = Def.Health`
- Only affect creatures still on board (not those that died this turn)

### 4. Implement Remaining Effect Functions
**Priority Order**:
1. `applyHeal()` - Similar to damage but increases life/health
2. `applyDrawCards()` - Use existing `Draw()` function
3. `applyBuffStats()` - Permanent attack/health increases

### 5. Add State-Based Effects Check
**Goal**: Comprehensive game state cleanup
**Details**:
- Create `checkStateBasedEffects()` function
- Handle creature death from various sources
- Future: Win condition checking, other state cleanup

## ðŸ§  Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Owner vs Controller**: Cards track both for proper graveyard handling
2. **Auto-Targeting**: UI passes `nil` for self/enemy effects, game auto-populates
3. **Graveyard Ordering**: Simplified (no ordering tracking for now)
4. **Zone Helper**: All-purpose `moveToGraveyard()` supporting all zones
5. **Effect Timing**: Sequential resolution with immediate state checks
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with meaningful error messages

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

**File Structure**:
- `internal/cards/cards.go` - Updated CardDef structure
- `internal/game/state.go` - Updated CardInstance with Owner/Controller
- `internal/game/playcard.go` - Multi-effect resolution system
- `internal/game/zones.go` - Zone management helper functions
- `internal/game/logic.go` - Updated card creation with ownership
- All test files updated for new structure

**Next Session Goals**:
1. Get first spell effects working (damage)
2. See creatures actually die and go to graveyard
3. Test the complete spell resolution pipeline
4. Implement creature healing mechanics

## ðŸŽ® Current Game State
The engine now has the architectural foundation for complex card interactions, proper ownership tracking, and sophisticated multi-effect spells. Ready to implement the actual game mechanics that make cards come alive!
